# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model and code for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on provided medical data.
Heart disease is a critical health issue affecting a significant portion of the population. Predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health factors is a crucial step towards timely intervention and treatment.
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can assist in early detection of heart disease using a dataset containing medical and demographic features.
The dataset includes the following features:
1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
